- first, object tracker (norfair openpose)
- then, face detector (opencv/bounding box/etc.)
- image classifier with augmentations (2 efficient net/2 dense net)
- for each person, 
- "self-annotating retrospective training"
    - inspired from tesla's auto-driving solution
    - use the annotations from the future frames to fix our previous mistakes
- self-reinforced training on the bad samples
    - fine tunes on its own in the wild
    - our model is already very good: 
- future work:
    - corrections to various kind of picture captures
    - for example: fisheye lens effect/exposure quality
